Hi, Iâ€™m Chilman

* I've started my journey in programming and game development in 2019 and have been gathering knowledge ever since.
* Looking for a junior programmer role, closest to game development as possible.
* Have been learning game development with Unity specifically since late 2020
* Currently working on my first big game, [Omnimancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694960/Omnimancer/): a magic focused rogue-like rpg.

I'm easy to be found through multiple places
