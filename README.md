Hi, I’m Chilman

* I've started my journey in programming and game development in 2019 and have been gathering knowledge ever since.
* I’m currently learning more about web development.
* Looking for a junior programmer role, closest to game development as possible.
* Have been learning more and more of game development with Unity specifically since late 2020 and am currently working on my first complete game after having made multiple simple and small projects for college.

I'm easy to be found through LinkedIn by my name, Matheus Wilhelms de Souza, but if you wish I can aslo be reached at mws_c@outlook.com
