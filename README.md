Hi, I’m Chilman

* I’m interested in programming in general but have a special affection to Artificial Inteligence
* I’m currently learning more about web development
* I’m looking for a junior programmer role, closest to game development as possible.
* Have been working with unity at an Amateur level for a while now

I'm easy to be found through LinkedIn by my name, Matheus Wilhelms de Souza, but if you wish I can aslo be reached at mws_c@outlook.com
